# Win Application Framework (WAF)
#### Successor of the WPF Application Framework

The Win Application Framework (WAF) is a lightweight Framework that helps you to create well structured XAML Applications. It supports you in applying a Layered Architecture and the Model-View-ViewModel (aka MVVM, M-V-VM, PresentationModel) pattern.

## Version 4

Starting with version 4 the framework comes with the new name Win Application Framework instead of WPF Application Framework. This rename shows that the framework supports now various application types:
-	WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
-	UWP (Universal Windows Platform)
-	Basic support for all .NET Core based applications

## Pre-release

Version 4 is still under development and not production ready yet.

At the moment it is recommended to use an older stable version of this framework. You will find these versions on CodePlex: http://waf.codeplex.com
